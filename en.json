        "body2": "The Law Society was established in 1988. In celebration of its 30th anniversary, the following highlight video was shared at the 2018 Leadership Conference.",
        "value_proposition": {
            "title": "Value Proposition",
            "body": "The mission statement of the J. Reuben Clark Law Society is comprehensive and clear: ",
            "mission_statement": "We affirm the strength brought to the law by a lawyer's personal religious conviction. We strive through public service and professional excellence to promote fairness and virtue founded upon the rule of law.",
            "body2": "While many legal professional organizations promote legal education and collegiality, very few have the unique foundation of religious conviction—conviction that we have a God-given responsibility to promote the rule of law and use our legal skills to serve our sisters and brothers. The Law Society provides its members with unique opportunities to learn and serve through their association with others who are motivated by this conviction. Membership of the Law Society extends to all legal professionals and law students worldwide who support this mission, regardless of where they attended law school and independent of religious or political affiliations."
        },
        "additional_detail": {
            "title": "Additional Detail",
            "p1": "Because strength often comes through concerted effort and supportive networks, the Law Society hosts events centered on local chapters, regional gatherings, and Society-wide events—primarily the Fireside broadcast and Annual Conference. These events foster the development of strong professional relationships and friendships. Learning from each other’s experiences, identifying colleagues with complementary professional skills, and finding wise mentors, all based on a shared foundation of moral conviction, are just a few of the informal benefits the Law Society provides.",
            "p2": "Continuing legal education is often provided at these events and 30+ hours of continuing legal education are offered each year in conjunction with BYU’s Education Week under the direction of the Law Society. These educational offerings help promote the professional excellence that is a key aspect of the Law Society’s mission. The Law Society focuses on providing education that not only hones legal skills but that uniquely underscores the ways religious convictions should influence our professional practices.",
            "p3": "Public service is primarily promoted and provided at the local chapter level. Helping others with their legal needs is fundamental to fulfilling the Law Society mission. The Law Society encourages public service by spotlighting the many ways local chapters and individual members are providing service, hopefully sparking ideas and identifying possibilities for others. Moreover, the Law Society is currently providing service opportunities in the criminal justice arena through our broad collaboration with the NAACP. The Law Society promotes public service in all its facets, but because of the key role religious convictions play in our mission, religious freedom is an arena where particular expertise is found."
        },
        "relationship": {
            "title": "Relationship to BYU Law Alumni Chapter",
            "body": "The Law Society’s membership is fairly evenly split between BYU Law graduates and graduates of other law schools. This broad membership is one of the key distinctions between the BYU Law Alumni Chapter and the Law Society. The Law Society needs and values its non-BYU graduates, and their contributions are immense. Moreover, BYU Law gratefully acknowledges that its students receive a great deal of support, particularly in finding employment opportunities, from non-BYU grads. On the flip side, the Law Society could not function as it currently does without the support of BYU and BYU Law. BYU President Kevin Worthen and other key administrators at BYU, particularly the dean of BYU Law, Gordon Smith, invest time and energy into ensuring the success of the Law Society. Employees of BYU Law from External Relations, Marketing and Communications, IT, and Finance devote significant amounts of time providing up front and behind the scenes support for the Law Society. Accordingly, while being sensitive to the fact that the Law Society is not simply another name for a BYU Law alumni group, BYU Law is appropriately given special recognition, access and other privileges because of its direct sponsorship of the Law Society."

As we team up beyond our own ranks, we hope to foster new friendships, build goodwill, and provide avenues for future collaboration and cooperation."

        "conclusion": "On a more personal note, I have been so blessed by my membership in the Law Society for many years. I have seen great examples of law and leadership, met wonderful people who have influenced me for good, and become more engaged in public service and religious freedom efforts. I hope the Law Society can be a blessing in your life as well. Please join us in helping the Law Society become an even more powerful force for good in the world.",

        "p1": "Joshua Reuben Clark was born on September 1, 1871, in the small farming town of Grantsville, a Mormon settlement thirty-five miles southwest of Salt Lake City. Although he did not begin his formal education until he was ten years old, young Reuben had been tutored at home by his mother and had developed a love for learning that lasted his entire life.",
        "p2": "On September 14, 1898, J. Reuben Clark married Luacine Annetta Savage in the Salt Lake Temple, with Dr. Talmage officiating at the ceremony. For the next four years he held various positions around the state as a teacher and administrator on both high school and college levels.",
        "p3": "In 1903 the Clarks, including two small children (two more were to follow), moved to New York City, where Reuben entered law school at Columbia University. His first year’s work was of such high quality that he was among the three second-year students elected to the editorial board of the Columbia Law Review. By the end of his second year he was admitted to the New York Bar. He received an LL.B. degree in 1906.",
        "p4": "Three months after graduating from law school, Reuben Clark was appointed assistant solicitor of the State Department by Elihu Root, secretary of state under President Theodore Roosevelt. Shortly thereafter he was also named an assistant professor of law at George Washington University , where he taught until 1908.",
        "p5": "In July 1910, under the administration of President William Howard Taft, Mr. Clark was appointed solicitor of the State Department. As part of his responsibilities he represented the United States in a dispute with Chile. The king of England, serving as arbitrator, ruled in favor of the United States and granted one of the largest international awards up to that time—nearly a million dollars. Also during his solicitorship, Clark published his classic “Memorandum on the Right to Protect Citizens in Foreign Countries by Landing Forces.” Secretary of State Philander C. Knox declared of Mr. Clark: “I am doing him but justice in saying that for natural ability, integrity, loyalty, and industry, I have not in a long professional and public service met his superior and rarely his equal.”",
        "p6": "J. Reuben Clark left the State Department in 1913 to open law offices in Washington, D.C., specializing in municipal and international law. His clients included the Japanese Embassy, Philander C. Knox, the Cuban Legation, the Guatemalan Ministry, J.P. Morgan & Company, and the Equitable Life Assurance Society.",
        "p7": "During World War I, Mr. Clark received a commission as major in the Judge Advocate General’s Officers’ Reserve Corps. In this capacity he helped prepare the original Selective Service regulations. He was then assigned on active duty to the U.S. attorney general’s office where he prepared “emergency Legislation and War Powers of the President.” In recognition of his meritorious service, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.",
        "p8": "By President Coolidge’s appointment, Mr. Clark became the under secretary of state in 1928. During this service he published the “Clark Memorandum on the Monroe Doctrine,” praised by critics as a “monument of erudition” and a “Masterly treatise.” The Law Society’s semiannual publication takes its name from this famous work.",
        "p9": "On October 3, 1930, J. Reuben Clark was named U.S. ambassador to Mexico. After his resignation two and a half years later, Mr. Clark’s diplomatic efforts were praised by President Herbert Hoover, who said, “Never have our relations been lifted to such a high point of confidence and cooperation.”",
        "p10": "In 1933, at age sixty-two, Mr. Clark’s lifelong devotion to the Church culminated in a new calling—counselor to President Heber J. Grant of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As a member of the First Presidency, President Clark was a leading supporter of the Church welfare plan. He also helped put the finances of the Church on a budget plan. He was an inspirational leader and spoke forcefully on topics including freedom, his court, the inspired Constitutions, work, integrity, and chastity. An avid student of the life and teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ, he authored many scholarly books on gospel topics.",
        "p11": "In addition to his Church duties, J. Reuben Clark continued to share his professional expertise as a member of corporate boards; government, political, and private committees; and academic journal and educational boards. He also bought and maintained a farm in Grantsville, his boyhood home."
